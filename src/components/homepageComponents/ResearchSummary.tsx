        Years of researching the fields of psychology, sociology, agriculture, ancient history, meditation, physical therapy,
        Chinese medicine, frequency medicine, yoga, hypnosis, fasting, the mind-body connection, applying every methodology, 
        and practicing for hundreds of hours with the sole focus of permanently making changes for IBS, ADHD, joint pain, 
        early stage insulin resistance, brain fog, led me to complete coursework, training with dozens of individuals, 
        and becoming Board Certified with the American Association of Natural Wellness Practitioners.
